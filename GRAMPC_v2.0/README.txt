- This is the entire framework, that enables running the formation controller in MATLAB
- All code that was written withing the scope of this thesis can be found in the folder "FormationController"
- Navigate to that folder to run the formation controller as follows:
--> To run the controller, run the file "startMPC.m"
--> To recompile the problem function (e.g. after changes in the file "probfct_formation-control.c"), run the command "startMPC(1,1)"
--> Change paramters and options in the file "initData.m"
