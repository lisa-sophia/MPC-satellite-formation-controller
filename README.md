# Model Predictive Spacecraft Formation Control with Nonlinear Lyapunov Stability Constraints

My bachelor thesis project for my BSc in Aerospace Computer Science. 
Implementation of a Model Predictive Controller to control the position of satellites in a satellite formation.
The code is implemented in C and Matlab using the software framework GRAMPC: A software framework for embedded nonlinear model predictive control using a gradient-based augmented Lagrangian approach (https://doi.org/10.1007/s11081-018-9417-2).
